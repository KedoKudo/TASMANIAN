# if given the Tasmanian install path, find_package() can be used to include the correct version of Tasmanian with all targets
find_package(Tasmanian @Tasmanian_VERSION_MAJOR@.@Tasmanian_VERSION_MINOR@.@Tasmanian_VERSION_PATCH@ PATHS "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@")

# Alternatively, a project can skip PATHS, but "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/" must be included in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
# this can be done from the command line with option -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/" then
# find_package(Tasmanian @Tasmanian_VERSION_MAJOR@.@Tasmanian_VERSION_MINOR@.@Tasmanian_VERSION_PATCH@)

# Alternatively, a project can directly include the exported targets with the following command
# include("@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/lib/@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@/@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@.cmake")
# Note: find_package() calls the above include command,
#       but also checks the version and defines _shared/_static independent targets

# Tasmanian library targets always end on either _shared or _static to denote the type of library
# which can be helpful to select a specific type of library (if desired)
# Either shared or static libraries are always available, in some cases both may be present
# The find_package(Tasmanian) command will also generate interface targets without _shared/_static appendix
# Tasmanian_libsparsegrid, Tasmanian_libdream, and Tasmanian_libfortran90 TARGETs will always point to a valid library
# if both _shared and _static libraries are present, the targets above will point to the _static ones

# Tasmanian_libsparsegrid, Tasmanian_libdream, and Tasmanian_libfortran90
# are just a convinient way to tell cmake to link to whatever is available
# without having to explicitly check for _static or _shared targets
